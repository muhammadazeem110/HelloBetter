**Objective:**  
You are joining the Data team at HelloBetter, a mental health platform providing digital therapeutic solutions. Your role as Data Engineer involves designing, building, and maintaining the data pipelines that extract data from various sources, transform it appropriately, and load it into our Data Warehouse for use by our Data Analysts, Data Scientists, ML Engineers, and stakeholders through Metabase.

HelloBetter has recently launched a chatbot that provides mental health support to users in the form of coaching. This chatbot generates detailed interaction logs, which are stored in a MongoDB database. Our Product team has requested that we integrate this data into our analytics platform and enrich it with weather data to analyze potential correlations between environmental factors and user mental states.

For example:  
> *Do individuals experience a happier mood on a sunny day?*
